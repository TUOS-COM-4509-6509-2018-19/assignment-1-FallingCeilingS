    "# Probability and an Introduction to Jupyter, Python and Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 29th September 2015 Neil Lawrence\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests). \n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first lecture we will think a little about 'how we got here' in terms of computer science. In the lecture itself, this will be done by taking a subjective perspective, that of my own 'data autobiography'."

    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this [here](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/index.html). "

    "#### Question 1 Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "- Who invented python and why?  \n",
    "    Guido van Rossum invented python. He is a programmer from Dutch.  \n",
    "    The primary reason why he invented python is that he planned to kill time around the Christmas week in 1989 by writing some exciting programming projects. Additionally, he decided to write an interpreter for a new scripting language, which is the descendant of ABC programming language during the project.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- What was the language designed to do?  \n",
    "    Python was designed to handle the exception and be the interface with the Amoeba operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the origin of the name \"python\"?  \n",
    "    \"Python\" was originated from the BBC TV show - \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the language a compiled language?  \n",
    "    Yes. Although Python is an interpreted language and it does not need to be compiled before machine code ahead of time, it still needs to be compiled to bytecode before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it an object orientated language?  \n",
    "    Yes."

We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a *markdown* box. Below we have a *code* box."

The result of this command on its own is a data series of `True` and `False` values. However, when it is passed to the `film_deaths` data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is `True`. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the `Body_Count` column in *descending* order we use the following command."

    "Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a *scripting* language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a *console*. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The *state* of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.  "

So if we are considering the outcome of an event, $Y$, to be a coin toss, then we might consider $Y=1$ to be heads and $Y=0$ to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation:\n",

    "    Several factors might cause wrong with the final estimation:\n",
    "    1. The too small scale of samples  \n",
    "        The dataset collected 421 films released from 1949 to 2009, during which total 200,108 films were released (we can get this data from [IMDB Advanced Title Search page](https://www.imdb.com/search/title)). That is to say, these films in the dataset only account for 0.21% of all films in that period. In other words, the number of samples is too limited to reflect the real world situation.\n",
    "    2. Unreasonable sampling ratio  \n",
    "        First, there are 226 films rated \"R\" and 89 films rated \"PG-13\": 53.68% and 21.14% of all 421 films in the dataset, respectively. However, by searching through [IMDB Advanced Title Search page](https://www.imdb.com/search/title), there are 12,531 films rated \"R\" and 3,148 films rated \"PG-13\": 6.26% and 1.57% of all 200,108 films released from 1949 to 2009, respectively. So the proportion of \"R\" and \"PG-13\" rating in sampling films is too high, compared with the realities of the situation.  \n",
    "        Plus, there are 265 films classified \"Action\" genre and 166 films classified \"Crime\" genre: 62.94% and 39.43% of all 421 films in the dataset, respectively. However, by searching through [IMDB Advanced Title Search page](https://www.imdb.com/search/title), there are 22,167 films classified \"Action\" genre and 15,334 films classified \"Crime\" genre: 11.08% and 7.66% of all 200,108 films released from 1949 to 2009, respectively. So the proportion of \"Action\" and \"Crime\" rating in sampling films is too high, compared with the realities of the situation, too.  \n",
    "        Moreover, a film that is rated \"R\" or \"PG-13\", or classified \"Action\" or \"Crime\" genre is more likely to contain violence materials, which are in all probability of lots of people die in a film. However, the actual ratio of these kinds of films is much less than the dataset.   \n",
    "        Thus, the result of the estimation is probably much higher than the real world situation. Additionally, it is much better to estimate the probability of people's death number by specific kind of MPAA rating or genre.\n",
    "    3. Ignored the impact of objective causes  \n",
    "        It is hard to estimate the probability of people's death number in a film by using this simple formula and dataset, because the number of films in a specific MPAA rating or genre varies from different periods, regions and cultural background, which will in turn impact creators to select themes and design scripts in their future films. Mainly speaking, the probability of people's death number in a film will be impacted by many objective factors or even film itself. However, the sampling method and calculation method did not consider these factors. Therefore, the result is probably unrepresentative to reflect the real world situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you think any film you go to in the cinema has this probability of having greater than 40 deaths?  \n",
    "    No. The result of the estimation is unrepresentative to reflect the real world situation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Why did we have to use float around our counts of deaths and total films?  \n",
    "    To make sure we promote operands before calculation so that we will calculate a correct float type result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What would the answer have been if we had not used float command?  \n",
    "    If we used Python 2, it would return 0, a rounded result from the operation. Since Python 2 kept the type with integer if all operands are using integer arithmetic. By contrast, we currently use Python 3, and it will return a float type result because Python 3 would automatically promote result to float type if the integer arithmetic result from operands cannot be an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we were using Python 3 would we have this problem?  \n",
    "    We are currently using Python 3."

    "When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is *independent* of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as *conditioning*. We use this notation, $P(Y=y|T=t)$, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case time). Or, often, for a shorthand we use $P(y|t)$ to represent this distribution (the $Y=$ and $T=$ being implicit). Because we don't believe a coin toss depends on time then we might write that \n",

Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what's the probability that the number of deaths was over 40 and the year was 2002?

    "Bayes rule is a very simple rule, it's hardly worth the name of a rule at all. It follows directly from the product rule of probability. Because $P(y, t) = P(y|t)P(t)$ and by symmetry $P(y,t)=P(t,y)=P(t|y)P(y)$ then by equating these two equations and dividing through by $P(y)$ we have\n",

    "which is known as Bayes' rule (or Bayes's rule, it depends how you choose to pronounce it). It's not difficult to derive, and its importance is more to do with the semantic operation that it enables. Each of these probability distributions represents the answer to a question we have about the world. Bayes rule (via the product rule) tells us how to *invert* the probability."
